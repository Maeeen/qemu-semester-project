// Gently ease
_American-Fuzzy-Lop plus plus_ (AFL++) is a popular fuzzer that has been used to
find numerous security vulnerabilities in software. The most effective way 
to fuzz is to have coverage-guided fuzzing: when source code is available,
AFL++ provides compiler plugins to compile the target software with
instrumentation that allows feedback to the fuzzer on interesting inputs.
However, for closed-source software, this is not possible.
There are several ways to address this issue, one of them is to use CPU emulation
and virtual machines. Therefore, AFL++ can be configured to use _Quick Emulator_
(QEMU) using that has been patched to support AFL++, namely
#link("https://github.com/AFLplusplus/qemuafl")[`qemuafl`].

// Whoops, there's a problem, but wait… QEMU has a plugin system!
However, the starting point of the fork of `qemuafl`
is 4 years old
#link("https://github.com/AFLplusplus/qemuafl/commit/5c65b1f135ff09d24827fa3a17e56a4f8a032cd5")[(commit 5c65b1f)]
and having a more recent of QEMU would be beneficial. Using a fork is not ideal
as fixes and improvements in the mainline QEMU are not available.
For end-users, it is not ideal to install twice the same software, each
having different features for the same goal, and each requiring another `make all`. #link("https://www.qemu.org/2019/12/13/qemu-4-2-0/")[QEMU 4.2]
has introduced a plugin system letting users extend QEMU with custom code.
Instead of using a fork of QEMU, it would be beneficial to use the plugin system to
integrate AFL++ with QEMU, distinctively and independently from the mainline
QEMU.

// Challenge of doing it
The challenges of this project are numerous, as QEMU is a complex piece of software,
maintained by a large community. The plugin system is sometimes not well documented,
and the interaction with AFL++ or QEMU is not straightforward.
The goal of this project is to add a piece of peace to the puzzle, by providing
a plugin that can be gently added to QEMU, filling the gap between a powerful
emulator and a powerful fuzzer. How powerful and limiting a plugin is, is yet
to be read by the reader currently reading this sentence.

In this report, we present the design and implementation of a QEMU plugin that
integrates AFL++ with QEMU, with very little to no effort. We will show that
our current implementation is able to fuzz simple programs, that room for
improvements is still there and that the plugin system remains to be improved.


#chapter(title: "Background")

//The background section introduces the necessary background to understand your
//work. This is not necessarily related work but technologies and dependencies
//that must be resolved to understand your design and implementation

Fuzzing is like a lab experiment with monkeys: if they discover
that doing a certain action gives them a banana, they will keep doing it; replace
the banana by a program crash and the monkey by a fuzzer and you have a very
simple analogy of what fuzzing is.
To be more formal and to put words on the analogy, fuzzing's goal is to find
crashes. It follows a simple routine:  
generate an input to a program, run the program with the input, and
observe the behavior of the program. If it crashes, it likely indicate an issue in the
program. The end-user is then free to investigate the crash and fix the issue,
as some of these crashes can turn out to be security vulnerabilities.

However, the fuzzer might take a while
to find what action gives them the #strike[banana] crash.
To guide the fuzzer in the right direction, we forward
to the fuzzer some feedback. This feedback is usually a coverage map of the
program, that tells the fuzzer which parts of the program have been executed.
Upon finding an input that triggers a new part of the program, the fuzzer will
keep this input and try to mutate it to possibly explore more parts of the
program. Many mutators exist, and a fuzzer can be as simple as a random
mutator or as complex as a genetic algorithm.

“*How coverage is obtained?*” you might ask. Many tools out there exist but they
essentially boil down to: at desired instructions in the program, before
executing, do _something_.
The _something_ can be as simple as incrementing a counter, or as complex as 
recording the path taken by the program. The simplest way taken by AFL++'s
instrumentation is to increment a counter at each basic block of the program. A
basic block is a sequence of instructions that is always executed in sequence; a
program is a list of basic blocks that are connected by jumps.

== Instrumentation under the hood

Let's take a simple program that reads a character from the standard input
and either crashes or prints "Try again!" depending on the character read:

#diagram(
  spacing: (5mm, 10mm),
  node-stroke: 1pt,
  edge-stroke: 1pt,
  node((0, 0), align(left, code("y = (short) random()\nx = get_char()"))),
  edge((0, 0), "d,l,d", "-|>", code("x < y"), label-sep: .2em), 
  edge((0, 0), "d,d", "-|>", code("x >= y"), label-side: left),
  node((0, 2), code("print(\"Try again!\")")),
  node((-1, 2), [#code("*0x0 = 0") #emoji.explosion]),
  edge((0, 2), "r", "uu", "l", "-|>")
)

Compile-time instrumentation will insert the following code (highlighted in #text(aqua, "aqua")) at the beginning of
each basic block:

#diagram(
  spacing: (10mm, 5mm),
  node-stroke: 1pt,
  edge-stroke: 1pt,
  node((0, -1), code("map[0]++"), stroke: aqua),
  edge((0, -1), "d", "-|>"),
  node((0, 0), align(left, code("y = (short) random()\nx = get_char()"))),
  edge((0, 0), "d,l,d", "-|>", code("x < 97"), label-sep: .2em), 
  edge((0, 0), "d,d", "-|>", code("x >= 97"), label-side: left),
  node((-1, 2), code("map[1]++"), stroke: aqua),
  edge((-1, 2), "d", "-|>"),
  node((-1, 3), [#code("*0x0 = 0") #emoji.explosion]),
  node((0, 2), code("map[2]++"), stroke: aqua),
  edge((0, 2), "d", "-|>"),
  node((0, 3), code("print(\"Try again!\")")),
  edge((0, 3), "r", "uuu", "l", "..|>", crossing: true),
  edge((0, 3), "rr", "uuuu", "ll", "-|>", stroke: aqua, crossing: true),
)

Therefore upon an execution, the fuzzer will have information on which basic
block has been inserted.

However, with such a `map[0…n]`, one must have an array in memory as long as the
number of basic blocks in the program. This is not ideal, as the memory
consumption can be high. To address this issue, AFL++ uses the following code,
where types have been explicitly added for clarity:

#codly-offset(offset: 247)
```c
(unsigned short) cur_location = <COMPILE_TIME_RANDOM>;
(unsigned short*) shared_mem[cur_location ^ prev_location]++; 

(unsigned short) prev_location = cur_location >> 1;
```
#align(right)[
  #link("https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt#:~:text=cur_location%20%3D%20%3CCOMPILE_TIME_RANDOM%3E%3B%0A%20%20shared_mem%5Bcur_location%20%5E%20prev_location%5D%2B%2B%3B%20%0A%20%20prev_location%20%3D%20cur_location%20%3E%3E%201%3B")[AFL technical details],
  #link("https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/d0587a3ac46b1652b1b51b3253c9833d0ea06a13/instrumentation/afl-compiler-rt.o.c#L248-L251", `AFLplusplus/instrumentation/afl-compiler-rt.o.c:248-251`), #link("https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/d0587a3ac46b1652b1b51b3253c9833d0ea06a13/instrumentation/afl-gcc-pass.so.cc#L217C1-L334C56")[`AFLplusplus/instrumentation/afl-gcc-pass.so.cc:217-334`]
]

To get back on our running example, it would look like the following:

#diagram(
  spacing: (10mm, 5mm),
  node-stroke: 1pt,
  edge-stroke: 1pt,
  node((0, -1), align(left, code("cur = 0xbeef\nshared_mem[cur ^ prev]++;\nprev = cur >> 1;")), stroke: aqua),
  edge((0, -1), "d", "-|>"),
  node((0, 0), align(left, code("y = (short) random()\nx = get_char()"))),
  edge((0, 0), "d,l,d", "-|>", code("x < 97"), label-sep: .2em), 
  edge((0, 0), "d,d", "-|>", code("x >= 97"), label-side: left),
  node((-1, 2), align(left, code("cur = 0xcafe\nshared_mem[cur ^ prev]++;\nprev = cur >> 1;")), stroke: aqua),
  edge((-1, 2), "d", "-|>"),
  node((-1, 3), [#code("*0x0 = 0") #emoji.explosion]),
  node((0, 2), align(left, code("cur = 0xf00d\nshared_mem[cur ^ prev]++;\nprev = cur >> 1;")), stroke: aqua),
  edge((0, 2), "d", "-|>"),
  node((0, 3), code("print(\"Try again!\")")),
  edge((0, 3), "r", "uuu", "l", "..|>", crossing: true),
  edge((0, 3), "rr", "uuuu", "ll", "-|>", stroke: aqua, crossing: true),
)

There is notable remarks to make: (1) the map is 64 kilo-bytes; (2) the constant `cur` 
are determined at compile-time; (3) the `prev` is a global variable, i.e. it is
stateful; (4) it is lossy.

The implementation details in the [AFL technical details] highlights that it can
effortlessly fit the L2 cache of the CPU, and that its stateful nature permits
to distinguish between different executions of the same program, that would still
invoke the same basic blocks.

This rather simple and elegant solution lets us devise a minimal specification
to provide the coverage map: indices of the basic blocks are random,
but should be deterministic across executions. Essentially, the fuzzer will
just notice a difference in the coverage map and mark it as interesting
[citation-needed.]

== Performance

The general idea as we have described until now is to do the following in a loop:

#diagram(
  spacing: (10mm, 10mm),
  node-stroke: 1pt,
  edge-stroke: 1pt,
  node((0, 0), enclose: ((0, -3), (0, 3)), [Fuzzer (AFL++)], stroke: teal, fill: teal.lighten(90%)),
  edge((0, -3), label: [1. Spawn program], "rrrrrr", "..|>"),
  node((6, -3), shape: circle, inset: 3pt, h(1pt)),
  edge((6, -3), label: [OS loads fuzzed binary], "dd", "--|>", label-side: left),
  edge((0, -1), label: [2. Send input], "rrrrrr", "-|>",  label-side: left),
  edge((6, 0), label: [Program exits], "d", "--|>", label-side: left),
  node((6, 1), shape: circle, inset: 3pt, h(1pt)),
  
  node((6, 0), align(center)[Program execution \#0], enclose: ((6, -1), (6, 0)),
    stroke: orange, fill: orange.lighten(90%)),
  edge((0, 1), label: [3. Get  coverage], "rrrrrr", "<|-"),
  edge((0, 2), "r,d,l", "-|>", label: [4. Mutate input], label-side: left),
)

However, this has its drawbacks: loading the executable is actually a procedure
can take a while, and the fuzzer is not doing anything during this time. The
devised solution is to use a fork server: instead of spawning the program,
let the fuzzed binary be loaded by the operating system, and upon a request
from the fuzzer, fork the process to be fuzzed. This way, instead of starting
from scratch at each iteration, the forked process will be already initialized.
Therefore, the actual protocol is as follows:

#diagram(
  spacing: (7mm, 10mm),
  node-stroke: 1pt,
  edge-stroke: 1pt,
  node((0, 0), enclose: ((0, -3), (0, 5)), [Fuzzer (AFL++)], stroke: teal, fill: teal.lighten(90%)),
  edge((0, -3), label: [0. Spawn program], "rrrrrrrrrr", "..|>"),
  node((10, -3), shape: circle, inset: 3pt, h(1pt)),
  edge((10, -3), label: [OS loads fuzzed binary], "d", "--|>", label-side: right),
  edge((0, -2), label: [1. Request new process], "rrrrrrrrrr", "-|>", label-side: left),
  edge((10, -1.5), label: [Fork], "lllll", "--|>", label-side: left, snap-to: (auto, <fork-start>)),
  node((5, -0), [Forked fuzzed binary], enclose: ((5, 0.5), (5, 0.5)),
    stroke: red, fill: red.lighten(90%)),
  node((5, -1.5), shape: circle, inset: 3pt, h(1pt)),
  edge((0, -0.25), label: [2. Send input], "rrrrr", "-|>"),
  edge((5, 0), label: [Fork exits], "d", "--|>", label-side: left),
  edge((5, -1.5), "d", "--|>"),
  node((5, 1), shape: circle, inset: 3pt, h(1pt), name: <fork-start>),
  node((10, -2), align(center)[Fuzzed binary], enclose: ((10, -2), (10, 5)),
    stroke: orange, fill: orange.lighten(90%)),
  
  edge((5, 1), label: [3. Get  coverage], "lllll", "-|>"),
  edge((0, 2), "r,d,l", "-|>", label: [4. Mutate input], label-side: left),
  edge((0, 4), label: [1. Request new process], "rrrrrrrrrr", "-|>", label-side: left),
