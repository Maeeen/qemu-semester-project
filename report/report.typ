// Gently ease
_American-Fuzzy-Lop plus plus_ (AFL++) is a popular fuzzer that has been used to
find numerous security vulnerabilities in software. The most effective way 
to fuzz is to have coverage-guided fuzzing: when source code is available,
AFL++ provides compiler plugins to compile the target software with
instrumentation that allows feedback to the fuzzer on interesting inputs.
However, for closed-source software, this is not possible.
There are several ways to address this issue, one of them is to use CPU emulation
and virtual machines. Therefore, AFL++ can be configured to use _Quick Emulator_
(QEMU) using that has been patched to support AFL++, namely
#link("https://github.com/AFLplusplus/qemuafl")[`qemuafl`].

// Whoops, there's a problem, but wait… QEMU has a plugin system!
However, the starting point of the fork of `qemuafl`
is 4 years old
#link("https://github.com/AFLplusplus/qemuafl/commit/5c65b1f135ff09d24827fa3a17e56a4f8a032cd5")[(commit 5c65b1f)]
and having a more recent of QEMU would be beneficial. Using a fork is not ideal
as fixes and improvements in the mainline QEMU are not available.
For end-users, it is not ideal to install twice the same software, each
having different features for the same goal, and each requiring another `make all`. #link("https://www.qemu.org/2019/12/13/qemu-4-2-0/")[QEMU 4.2]
has introduced a plugin system letting users extend QEMU with custom code.
Instead of using a fork of QEMU, it would be beneficial to use the plugin system to
integrate AFL++ with QEMU, distinctively and independently from the mainline
QEMU.

// Challenge of doing it
The challenges of this project are numerous, as QEMU is a complex piece of software,
maintained by a large community. The plugin system is sometimes not well documented,
and the interaction with AFL++ or QEMU is not straightforward.
The goal of this project is to add a piece of peace to the puzzle, by providing
a plugin that can be gently added to QEMU, filling the gap between a powerful
emulator and a powerful fuzzer. How powerful and limiting a plugin is, is yet
to be read by the reader currently reading this sentence.

In this report, we present the design and implementation of a QEMU plugin that
integrates AFL++ with QEMU, with very little to no effort. We will show that
our current implementation is able to fuzz simple programs, that room for
improvements is still there and that the plugin system remains to be improved.


#chapter(title: "Background")

//The background section introduces the necessary background to understand your
//work. This is not necessarily related work but technologies and dependencies
//that must be resolved to understand your design and implementation

Fuzzing is like a lab experiment with monkeys: if they discover
that doing a certain action gives them a banana, they will keep doing it; replace
the banana by a program crash and the monkey by a fuzzer and you have a very
simple analogy of what fuzzing is.
To be more formal and to put words on the analogy, fuzzing's goal is to find
crashes. It follows a simple routine:  
generate an input to a program, run the program with the input, and
observe the behavior of the program. If it crashes, it likely indicate an issue in the
program. The end-user is then free to investigate the crash and fix the issue,
as some of these crashes can turn out to be security vulnerabilities.

However, the fuzzer might take a while
to find what action gives them the #strike[banana] crash.
To guide the fuzzer in the right direction, we forward
to the fuzzer some feedback. This feedback is usually a coverage map of the
program, that tells the fuzzer which parts of the program have been executed.
Upon finding an input that triggers a new part of the program, the fuzzer will
keep this input and try to mutate it to possibly explore more parts of the
program. Many mutators exist, and a fuzzer can be as simple as a random
mutator or as complex as a genetic algorithm.

To get coverage, many tools out there exist but they
essentially boil down to: at desired instructions in the program, before
executing, do _something_.
The _something_ can be as simple as incrementing a counter, or as complex as 
recording the path taken by the program. The simplest way taken by AFL++'s
instrumentation is to increment a counter at each basic block of the program. A
basic block is a sequence of instructions that is always executed in sequence; a
program is a list of basic blocks that are connected by jumps.

In the following subsections, we will devise the requirements for the plugin.

#subchapter(title: "Instrumentation under the hood")

As a small running example, consider a simple program that reads a character from
the standard input
and either crashes or prints "Try again!" depending on the read character as
depicted in @simple_program_cfg.

#figure(
  diagram(
    spacing: (5mm, 10mm),
    node-stroke: 1pt,
    edge-stroke: 1pt,
    node((0, 0), align(left, code("y = (short) random()\nx = get_char()"))),
    edge((0, 0), "d,l,d", "-|>", code("x < y"), label-sep: .2em), 
    edge((0, 0), "d,d", "-|>", code("x >= y"), label-side: left),
    node((0, 2), code("print(\"Try again!\")")),
    node((-1, 2), [#code("*0x0 = 0") #emoji.explosion]),
    edge((0, 2), "r", "uu", "l", "-|>")
  ),
  caption: [The Control Flow Graph of the running example: reads a character and crashes if it is less than a random number]
) <simple_program_cfg>


Compile-time instrumentation will insert the following code (highlighted in #text(teal, "teal")) at the beginning of
each basic block, as depicted in @simple_program_cfg_instru.

#figure(
  diagram(
    spacing: (10mm, 5mm),
    node-stroke: 1pt,
    edge-stroke: 1pt,
    node((0, -1), code("map[0]++"), stroke: teal),
    edge((0, -1), "d", "-|>"),
    node((0, 0), align(left, code("y = (short) random()\nx = get_char()"))),
    edge((0, 0), "d,l,d", "-|>", code("x < 97"), label-sep: .2em), 
    edge((0, 0), "d,d", "-|>", code("x >= 97"), label-side: left),
    node((-1, 2), code("map[1]++"), stroke: teal),
    edge((-1, 2), "d", "-|>"),
    node((-1, 3), [#code("*0x0 = 0") #emoji.explosion]),
    node((0, 2), code("map[2]++"), stroke: teal),
    edge((0, 2), "d", "-|>"),
    node((0, 3), code("print(\"Try again!\")")),
    edge((0, 3), "r", "uuu", "l", "..|>", crossing: true),
    edge((0, 3), "rr", "uuuu", "ll", "-|>", stroke: teal, crossing: true),
  ),
  caption: [The Control Flow Graph of the running example with instrumentation]
) <simple_program_cfg_instru>

Therefore upon an execution, the fuzzer will have information on which basic
block has been inserted.

However, with such a `map[0…n]`, one must have an array in memory as long as the
number of basic blocks in the program. This is not ideal, as the memory
consumption can be high. To address this issue, AFL++ uses the following code,
where types have been explicitly added for clarity:

#codly-offset(offset: 247)
```c
(unsigned short) cur_location = <COMPILE_TIME_RANDOM>;
((unsigned short*) shared_mem)[cur_location ^ prev_location]++; 

(unsigned short) prev_location = cur_location >> 1;
```
#align(right)[

]

To get back on the example, it would look like the following:

#diagram(
  spacing: (10mm, 5mm),
  node-stroke: 1pt,
  edge-stroke: 1pt,
  node((0, -1), align(left, code("cur = 0xbeef\nshared_mem[cur ^ prev]++;\nprev = cur >> 1;")), stroke: aqua),
  edge((0, -1), "d", "-|>"),
  node((0, 0), align(left, code("y = (short) random()\nx = get_char()"))),
  edge((0, 0), "d,l,d", "-|>", code("x < 97"), label-sep: .2em), 
  edge((0, 0), "d,d", "-|>", code("x >= 97"), label-side: left),
  node((-1, 2), align(left, code("cur = 0xcafe\nshared_mem[cur ^ prev]++;\nprev = cur >> 1;")), stroke: aqua),
  edge((-1, 2), "d", "-|>"),
  node((-1, 3), [#code("*0x0 = 0") #emoji.explosion]),
  node((0, 2), align(left, code("cur = 0xf00d\nshared_mem[cur ^ prev]++;\nprev = cur >> 1;")), stroke: aqua),
  edge((0, 2), "d", "-|>"),
  node((0, 3), code("print(\"Try again!\")")),
  edge((0, 3), "r", "uuu", "l", "..|>", crossing: true),
  edge((0, 3), "rr", "uuuu", "ll", "-|>", stroke: aqua, crossing: true),
)

There is notable remarks to make: (1) the map is 64 kilo-bytes; (2) the constant `cur` 
are determined at compile-time; (3) the `prev` is a global variable, i.e. it is
stateful; (4) it is lossy.

The implementation details in the [AFL technical details] highlights that it can
effortlessly fit the L2 cache of the CPU, and that its stateful nature permits
to distinguish between different executions of the same program, that would still
invoke the same basic blocks.

This rather simple and elegant solution lets us devise a minimal specification
to provide the coverage map: indices of the basic blocks are random,
but should be deterministic across executions. Essentially, the fuzzer will
just notice a difference in the coverage map and mark it as interesting
#cite-needed

#subchapter(title: "Performance")

The general idea as we have described until now is to do these steps:

1. 

#figure(
  diagram(
    spacing: (10mm, 10mm),
    node-stroke: 1pt,
    edge-stroke: 1pt,
    node((0, 0), enclose: ((0, -3), (0, 3)), [Fuzzer (AFL++)], stroke: teal, fill: teal.lighten(90%)),
    edge((0, -3), label: [1. Spawn program], "rrrrrr", "..|>"),
    node((6, -3), shape: circle, inset: 3pt, h(1pt)),
    edge((6, -3), label: [OS loads fuzzed binary], "dd", "--|>", label-side: left),
    edge((0, -1), label: [2. Send input], "rrrrrr", "-|>",  label-side: left),
    edge((6, 0), label: [Program exits], "d", "--|>", label-side: left),
    node((6, 1), shape: circle, inset: 3pt, h(1pt)),
    
    node((6, 0), align(center)[Program execution \#0], enclose: ((6, -1), (6, 0)),
      stroke: orange, fill: orange.lighten(90%)),

    edge((0, 2), "r,d,l", "-|>", label: [4. Mutate input], label-side: left),
  ), caption: [The fuzzing process]
)

However, this has its drawbacks: loading the executable is actually a procedure
can take a while, and the fuzzer is not doing anything during this time. The
devised solution is to use a fork server #cite-needed: instead of spawning the
program,
let the fuzzed binary be loaded by the operating system, and upon a request
from the fuzzer, fork the process to be fuzzed. This way, instead of starting
from scratch at each iteration, the forked process will be already initialized
and ready for input.
Therefore, the actual protocol is as follows:

#figure(
  diagram(
    spacing: (7mm, 10mm),
    node-stroke: 1pt,
    edge-stroke: 1pt,
    node((0, 0), enclose: ((0, -3), (0, 5)), [Fuzzer (AFL++)], stroke: teal, fill: teal.lighten(90%)),
    edge((0, -3), label: [0. Spawn program], "rrrrrrrrrr", "..|>"),
    node((10, -3), shape: circle, inset: 3pt, h(1pt)),
    edge((10, -3), label: [OS loads fuzzed binary], "d", "--|>", label-side: right),
    edge((0, -2), label: [1. Request new process], "rrrrrrrrrr", "-|>", label-side: left),
    edge((10, -1.5), label: [Fork], "lllll", "--|>", label-side: left, /*snap-to: (auto, <fork-start>)*/),
    node((5, -0), [Forked fuzzed binary], enclose: ((5, -1.5), (5, 0.5)),
      stroke: red, fill: red.lighten(90%)),
    edge((0, -1), label: [2. Send input], "rrrrr", "-|>"),
    edge((5, 0), label: [Fork exits], "d", "--|>", label-side: left),
    node((5, 1), shape: circle, inset: 3pt, h(1pt), name: <fork-start>),
    node((10, -2), align(center)[Fuzzed binary], enclose: ((10, -2), (10, 5)),
      stroke: orange, fill: orange.lighten(90%)),
    
    edge((5, 1), label: [3. Get  coverage, and exit code], "lllll", "-|>"),
    edge((0, 2), "r,d,l", "-|>", label: [4. Mutate input], label-side: left),
    edge((0, 4), label: [1. Request new process], "rrrrrrrrrr", "-|>", label-side: left),
    node((5, 4.5), $dots.v$, stroke: none)
  ),
  caption: [The AFL process with a fork server.])

To implement the plugin rather effectively, the `fork` syscall should happen 
in the plugin, as close as possible before the execution of the fuzzed binary.

#subchapter(title: "Conclusion")

We have devised rather simple requirements for the plugin: it should provide
a coverage map that is deterministic across forks, and it *should* fork. Not
filling the requirements will result in a fuzzer that is, by design, less
effective than `qemuafl`. The obvious main requirement is to *not modify
a single line of QEMU's code*.

#subchapter(title: "QEMU introduction")

“QEMU is a binary translator” #cite-needed is the most effective way to describe
how it works. It is a piece of software that reads a binary and translates it
to the host's architecture. It can also simulate a whole system, but we will focus
only on userspace emulation, `x86_64-linux-user` for the purpose of this
project. However, we will define the relevant parts.

QEMU reads the binary, basic block per basic block, and translates them into
an _intermediate representation_ (IR) called TCG (for Tiny Code Generator). 
There is two parts for the translation: the frontend, that reads the binary and
translates it into TCG, and the backend, that translates the TCG into the host's
architecture. The frontend is target-specific, and the backend is host-specific.


// Let's take our running, but, compiled (and simplified assembly):
// #diagram(
//   debug: 1,
//   spacing: (5mm, 10mm),
//   node-stroke: 1pt,
//   edge-stroke: 1pt,
//   node((0, 0), shape: rect, align(left, __asm__("call <getc>\nrand %bx\ncmp %ax, %bx\njl <unvalid>"))),
//   edge((0, 0.25), "l,d", "-|>", code("x < y"), label-sep: .2em, snap-to: (auto, <explosion>)), 
//   edge((0, 0), "d", "-|>", /* [#code("x >= y"), implicitly], */label-side: right),
//   node((0, 1), align(left, [$dots.h$\ #__asm__("call <puts>\njmp <main>")])),
//   node((-1, 1), [#__asm__("mov $0x0, 0x0") #emoji.explosion], name: <explosion>),
//   edge((0, 1.30), "r", "u", (1, -0.35), "l", "-|>"),
//   edge((2, 0.5), "rr", "-|>")
// )

QEMU will translate each basic block (here, a node) to TCG, and then to the
host's architecture. The translation is done lazily (i.e. done when it is
required to be done), and the translation is cached.

QEMU's internal can be drawn as the following: #TODO

With plugins, here is a non-exhaustive list of what callbacks can be added:
- on syscalls
- on instructions (either add an inline `add` instruction or
  a callback to a plugin-defined function)
- on virtual CPU initialization
- on memory accesses
but it also have some drawbacks, notably, one can not inspect the internals of
the emulator, e.g. TCG code: QEMU deserves a book on its own, so we will go
through each part as needed.




This section is usually 3-5 pages.


#chapter(title: "Coverage and forking design tentatives // Towards a PoC")

#subchapter(title: "Instrumentation")


The instrumentation is a key component of any fuzzing tools, and can be
implemented in an easy manner with plugins, in less than 11 lines of C code:

```c
int qemu_plugin_install(…) {
  qemu_plugin_register_vcpu_tb_trans_cb(…, on_tb_trans);
}

// On translation, this function will be executed.
void vcpu_tb_trans(…, struct qemu_plugin_tb *tb) {
  // Get the virtual address (guest) of the first instruction
  uint64_t vaddr = qemu_plugin_insn_vaddr(qemu_plugin_tb_get_insn(tb, 0));
  // Register a callback on execution for the basic block
  qemu_plugin_register_vcpu_tb_exec_cb(tb, tb_exec, QEMU_PLUGIN_CB_NO_REGS, (void*) vaddr);
}

// On execution of a TB, this function will be executed.
void tb_exec(…, void* user_data) {
  uint64_t address = (uint64_t) user_data;
  // The translation block at `address` has been executed.
  has_been_executed(address);
}
```

This is a really strong point compared to `qemuafl`: the change is minimal, and
does not involve messing around with the TCG translation (at least… indirectly.)
To comply with callbacks, QEMU inserts a `call` instruction to the plugin's
`tb_exec` callback at the beginning of each TB. Design-wise, it is simple,
easily maintanable and therefore easy to change and improve!

Note as well that it relies heavily on QEMU's correctness with its internal
implementation: a possible doubt that we had was that, for performance reason,
QEMU can chain TBs together, and that `tb_exec` would be called only once for
the whole chain. However, from tests that we have conducted, it seems that
the unexpected behavior we have described is not happening and that
the chaining of TBs is invisible to the plugin. However,
note that this has been an issue for `qemuafl` until 2018, where `qemuafl` was
explicitly disabling the chaining of TBs, but has now been fixed.
#cite(<qemuafl_and_chain>)

But this is only the first part of building the plugin, the second part is to
make the `fork` in fork server happen.

#subchapter(title: "A first attempt to forking")


Let play it simple in a pragmatic way of learning: what happens if we `fork` inside the plugin? Let's make it
at initialization:

```c
int qemu_plugin_install(…) {
  fork();
}
```

We obtain the following while running the plugin:

```
qemu: qemu_mutex_unlock_impl: Operation not permitted
```

$arrow$ There is a lock taken at plugin initialization, and it's not really too
much of a surprise, if one reads the documentation:

#quote(block: true, attribution: [https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/tcg-plugins.html#locking])[
  We have to ensure we cannot deadlock, particularly under MTTCG. For this we acquire a lock when called from plugin code. We also keep the list of callbacks under RCU so that we do not have to hold the lock when calling the callbacks. This is also for performance, since some callbacks (e.g. memory access callbacks) might be called very frequently.
]

So, it seems that we can't `fork` at initialization…

We considered temporarily making a `fork` in user-space: wait for a signal from
the plugin, `fork` then `exec` the fuzzed binary. However, if an emulated
program in QEMU makes the `exec` syscall (e.g. `exec("sl")`), the `exec` syscall
is forwarded to the host's kernel. Therefore, this idea has been
dropped.

What about other callbacks? In this setup, a good thought would be to think of
places where no TCG is
involved. One of these places where plugin callbacks can be registered where the
TCG is not involved is on the initialization of a virtual CPU. We will propose
a second solution later in a future, yet to be read, chapter.

So, here is where we are:

AFL and the target binary communicate through a pipe, consisting of two file
descriptors, namely 198 and 199. The target binary reads from the file
descriptor.
